The folder "assignment-2" contains three files- "server.cpp", "client.cpp" and "chat_history".

The file "chat_history" already contains some chat logs corresponding to the demo video which was run and recorded so as to show the functioning of the code of socket programming and showing the correct compilation and running steps to be followed to avoid errors. 

KINDLY CLEAR THE CHAT_HISTORY FILE BEFORE COMPILATION TO SEE THE RESULTS IN A BETTER FORMAT

## DESCRIPTION:

In order to run the files successfully at your platform, one would need to download the folder "assignment-2".

Later, corresponding to each of the files "server.cpp" and "client.cpp" firstly one would need to run the following compilation commands respectively-

- g++ -o server server.cpp
- g++ -o client client.cpp
  
Further, the commands-

- ./server
- ./client
  
are needed to be run in separate terminals in order to see a client-server conversation

## FILES:

- ### Assignment-2 recording:
  
  - The recording contains a demo-conversation between the server and client set up
  - For clear execution of your code, kindly follow the steps as shown in the video
  - Also, the content in the "chat_history" is present as per the updations made during the video
  
- ### server.cpp:
  - The file contains code corresponding to the connections from the server's perspective
  - This includes writing its part of the conversation in the chat_history file as well
  - The compilation command for execution of the files is also given at the bottom of the code in a commented format for easy execution

- ### client.cpp:
  - The file contains code corresponding to the connections from the client's perspective
  - Description corresponding to each function and code segment has been provided for comfort
  - Kindly avoid usage of escape characters in the messages since they might affect the storage of chat logs, since so far it is a simple application

- ### chat_history:
  - It contains the history of the demo chat covered in the video, for clearer reference
  - Kindly clear the chat before execution for visibility of clear results
