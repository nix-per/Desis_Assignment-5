The folder "assignment-5" contains 2 the folders corresponding to the two assignments problems respectively.

Due to its heavy nature, the PDF file "DESIS COURSE CONTENT" has not been included in the repository. The file consists of sections corresponding to each of the technical courses covered throughout the Ascend Educare Program. Screenshots of the PPT slides have been included in the file, along with the course name. 
The PDF was then used for chatbot repsonses. 

The above was done due to unavailability of the following permissions in the course material:
- Downloading access
- Printing access
- Copying file access
- Copying content access


## DESCRIPTION:
Since the assignment consisted of two internal problems, the structure of the files is as follows:
- Problem-1 (Managing Context Limitations)
  - Strategies Proposed and Studied
- Problem-2 (Course Content Chatbot)
  - Chatbot Documentation
  - Course Material Chatbot.ipynb
  
The file "Course Material Chatbot.ipynb" contains the colab notebook with chatbot implementation.

The view-only colab notebook link is present in the Chatbot Documentation, along with the entire trajectory of construction of the chatbot, challenges and learnings.
